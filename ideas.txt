1. use different series decomposition techniques for representation learning in EcmP, instead of the linear layers.





observations
1. the d_patch has to be suitable for the different sequence length. Due to the representation learning capability.
2. so does the d_model
3. in a suitable case it outperforms PatchTST
4. Testing the trailing padding modes

5. check positional encoding and if it works
    both PatchTST and EcmP have performance gain without the positional encoding

6. test scaling and check if it affects performance
